#README

fresh-tomatoes is yet another movie rating app, featuring some of my
nephew's favorite movies! For each movie, the name, poster image, 
release year, and rating are listed. Upon clicking on a movie tile,
the trailer for the movie will begin playing!

## Getting Started

To run this project, simply clone the project locally to your
computer from the command line:

`git clone https://github.com/harrymasson/fresh-tomatoes.git`

Change directory into the cloned project:

`cd fresh-tomatoes`

And run the python script 'entertinment_center.py`:

`python ./entertainment_center.py`

The HTML page should automatically open in your default browser!
